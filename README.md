1. RecreateAWebpageActivity

Select a webpage from this website (except do not select the one that I used): https://www.html.am/templates/simple-website-templates/

Create a folder in your editor
Input two html pages: original.html and withedits.html
Input two css pages: original.css and withedits.css

Watch 2 or 3 videos (search "box model css" on youtube) from the following selection of videos:
https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=box+model+css

Recreate the website you have selected in "original.html" and "original.css".

Recreate the website you have selected in "withedits.html" and "withedits.css" -10 changes to properties of "border", "padding" and "margin" - also change the Color Scheme to one of your liking. 

All of the content (text and components) should be viewable but the site should have a much different look. 

Save your files in a github repository and pass in the github repository.
